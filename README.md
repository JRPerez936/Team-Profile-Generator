  # Team-Profile-Generator

  ## Description
  This repo contains Node.js code for a "Team Profile Generator". I was tasked with building my own code in order for it to produce professional looking readme documents that anyone could use by following the steps listed in the installation section. By using Node.js, Jest, and Inquirer, users will answer questions that will allow the program to produce a fully functional and professional Readme. An example of this process can be found [here](#usage)

  ## Installation
  1. [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) & Install Node.js
  2. Clone this repository or download this code from Github
  3. Using command prompt/terminal, change the directory to be in the folder with the code (WK10C-Team-Profile-Generator)
  4. Type "npm install inquirer" and hit Enter.
  5. type "npm install jest" and hit Enter.
  6. Once inquirer and jest have been installed, type "node index.js". Answer each prompt and hit enter to move to the next until you see "File Created" & "Style Sheet Created" print in the terminal.
  7. Once complete, navigate to your file explorer and enter the folder where you have the Team Profile Generator. Inside it there should be a "dist" folder and in that folder should be your fully generated readme
